Stripe PM Take Home Project by Hadi Laasi
=========================================


Context
-------
My background is as a python dev + learning some swift + swiftUI at the moment.
However, when I got asked to do this assignemnt, I thought I'd try a new stack 
and picked up React/Node.js/Express for the first time.

The project that I've built is a joke startup idea where you can submit a list 
of your tasks and a PM would create a roadmap for your life! I'd like to 
apologise for the code base being incredibly hacky/rough -- it's my first time
building a react app, so here goes nothing!


Instructions to Run
===================

1. git clone https://github.com/iceanfire/stpe.git
2. Go to the main directory (stpe) and run: npm install (this installs the node.js server)
3. cd client
4. npm install (this installs the react pre-requisites)
5. node server.js (this starts the backend server on port 3001)
6. npm start (this starts the react app on port 3000)
